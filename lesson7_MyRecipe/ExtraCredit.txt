The first feature I added was a button that allows the user to change the recipe for Chicken Long Rice. By clicking on this button, it shows a list item and a paragraph that were previously hidden. It also hides the chicken broth list item when chicked.  I used the first method to call on one of those elements. To make them visible, I added a green background color. The button can be toggled again to hide the elements again. I also added a css function to make the line-height larger. I wanted to add an effect, so I used the jQuery hover effect. When the user hovers over a paragraph or list node,  the background will turn to a blue background. I wanted the hover to only work while the mouse is over the specific node and to disappear as soon as the mouse is moved away. To do this, I made sure that the hover then returned to the original background color.
