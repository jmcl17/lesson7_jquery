      <h2>Chicken Long Rice</h2>
      <h3>Ingredients</h3>
      <ul class="ingr">
         <li hidden id="hidden">3 chicken bouillon cubes</li>
         <li>2 cans of chicken stock</li>
         <li>2-3 boneless/skinless chicken breasts</li>
         <li>3 inches of ginger, peeled and chopped into quarters</li>
         <li>2 medium cloves of garlic, peeled and chopped in half</li>
         <li>2 table spoons of soy sauce</li>
         <li>1 cup of water</li>
         <li>2 packages (around 7.75 oz each) of bean thread noodles</li>
         <li>1 bunch of green onions, cut into small pieces</li>
         <li>1 bay leaf</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Instructions</h3> 
      <div class="instr">
         
         <p hidden id="hidden2"> 0) Crush chicken bouillon cubes and combine with three cups of water. Stir until chicken bouillon is completely dissolved in water and becomes liquid broth. Set aside.</p>
      
         <p>1) In a large pot, combine chicken broth, water, ginger, green onions, bay leaf, garlic, soy sauce, and Â½ tsp of black pepper on medium heat. Bring to a boil then reduce heat to medium low.</p>
         
         <p>2) While the mixture is simmering, cut chicken breast into bite size pieces and add them to the pot. Cover the pot and let cook for 20-25 minutes.</p>
         
         <p>3) In a medium bowl, place bean sprout noodles in with enough cold water to completely submerge the noodles. Let the noodles soak for roughly 15 minutes. The bean sprout noodles need adequate time to soak up the water, so the longer the noodles are submerged in cold water the better. Once the noodles have softened, drain them and cut noodles into manageable pieces. Set aside.</p>
         
         <p>4) Bring heat to medium high and add noodles plus green onions. Cover and cook for 8-10 minutes. Stir occasionally. Salt and pepper to season. Then serve immediately. </p>
